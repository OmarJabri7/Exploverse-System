# Exploverse System

## Introduction
Welcome to the Exploverse System, an innovative Non-Fungible Token (NFT) generation platform designed to create unique, rarity-based NFT collectibles. This system leverages layered artwork to generate distinctive NFT images and corresponding metadata, ensuring each token's uniqueness and rarity.

## Features
- Automated NFT image generation by layer combination.
- Rarity-based trait assignment through weighted randomness.
- Concurrent batch processing for efficient NFT creation.
- Custom metadata generation for each NFT, including attributes and image URI.

## Installation
To set up the Exploverse System, ensure you have Python installed. Then, install the necessary Python libraries with the following command:
```bash
pip install Pillow tqdm numpy
```

## Usage
Initiate the NFT generation process by executing the script from your command line:
```bash
python exploverse_system.py
```
Make sure to replace `exploverse_system.py` with the actual script filename.

## Configuration
Configure your generation system by adjusting the following files:
- `rarity.json`: This file should define the rarity for each trait in your NFT collection.
- `counter.txt`: This file tracks the sequential count of your NFTs.

## How It Works
1. `generate_nfts`: At the heart of the system, this function creates the NFT images and metadata.
2. `generate_weights`: This function determines trait rarity and assigns appropriate weights.
3. `run_gen`: This function orchestrates the generation process, utilizing multithreading for efficiency.
